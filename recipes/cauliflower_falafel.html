        <h3>Everyone loves falafel!</h3>
        
        <p>Everyone loves falafel. Unfortunately, traditional falafel is high
            in histamine. This is a healthy low-histamine twist on this
            Middle-Eastern classic. The cauliflower, onions, garlic, and 
            parsley provide histamine-reducing quercetin, fiber, and lots of
            micronutrients to sustain your energy for the day.
